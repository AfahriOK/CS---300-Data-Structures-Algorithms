# CS-300-Data-Structures-Algorithms
This class taught me about the pros and cons of different data structures. The purpose of this project was to create a program to read a list of classes and create a data structure to hold that information. Our choices were an array, a vector, a hash table, or a binary searh tree. The program requirements were that we could add new classes, look up those classes, and sort the data to print it all out in alphanumeric order. I chose a binary search tree ass my data structure for this program because the classes could be searched for in O(log N) time and the format of the tree would make it easy to sort the data. A hash table might have been faster for searching but it would be harder to sort and the data input for this program is not that large.
