# Data Structures & Algorithms

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The purpose of this project was to create a program to read a list of classes and create a data structure to hold that information. Our choices were an array, a vector, a hash table, or a binary searh tree. The program requirements were that we could add new classes, look up those classes, and sort the data to print it all out in alphanumeric order.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
First, I had to look at what I was trying to accomplish so I could pick the best data structure. The program had to look up different classes so I wanted it to be fast but it also had to be able to sort all the data and put it in alphanumeric order so I chose a binary search tree as for this program because the classes could be searched for in O(log N) time and the format of the tree would make it easy to sort the data. A hash table might have been faster for searching O(1) but it would be harder to sort and the data input for this program is not that large.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
At times I got stuck trying to figure out how to do something but a quick google search would get me back on track.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has shown me that you should put some thought into what kind of data structure you would like to use for your specific problem because it can make a big impact especially as your data sets get larger.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program reinforced the idea that I should comment my code and make sure it isn't redundant due to all the different complex methods used to create the binary search tree.
